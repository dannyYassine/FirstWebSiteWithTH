            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I graduated at Concordia University in the Civil engineering program, specializing in infrastructure. To add, I am currently doing a Diploma in Web Programming (Certificate in Web Development & PHP/MySQL Web Applications) during the evenings.
            </p>
            <p>As for professional experience, I have freelance work for the company MyPiece for their new iOS update before the holidays. I developed and redesigned their User Interface and restructured the Sign Up and Sign In pages to give the user a better experience. To add, the user is now prompted to enter a promotion code for the new campaign and this information is saved to a third-party server. As for more freelance work, I was given a project template on PDF and I had figured out the internal structure of the application from the UI experience to seamlessly saving data to a server, all behind the scenes. Custom accessory views were designed and proved to be effective to give the user an easy and efficient involvement entering their information.
            </p>
            <p>While working on iOS applications, I highly plan out the architectural structure and models to implement for the efficient backend. Although developing the implementation is important, designing the User Interface and User Experience are as important, thus giving the best first impression. Utilizing many different APIs and third parties like Parse, CocoaPods and many available on GitHub proved to be successful to deliver a great experience for the user.
            </p>
            <p>To continue, I worked with the company AGIR Consultants INC. as a junior civil engineer / Inspector. My responsibilities were to monitor construction sites for the client Bell Canada, and if necessary, contact the client for the approval of extras, and more, contact the designer for major changes to the underground cables. I was the technical support on site and on call of the contractor during the work, I made sure that the work was done safely and that the installations were in compliance with the clientâ€™s specifications. In addition, I prepared documents for new construction sites and daily prepared a list of ongoing projects in order to assign them to all inspectors, and I was responsible for responding to emergencies where I had to assign an inspector to a new project. Eventually, I train interns for their entry to the company, making follow-ups and answering their questions.
            </p>
            <p>To add, I had an internship during the summer of 2013 with the company Garnier Construction on a Hydro-Quebec project as Assistant Quality Assurance/Inspector. My responsibilities were all of the structural inspections before pouring concrete, ensure that the quality system of the company is applied and effective, and ultimately manage and coordinate with the construction team.
