                <h4>MyPiece</h4>
                <p>I have done freelance work for the company MyPiece for their new iOS update before the holidays.
                    I developed and redesigned their User Interface and restructured the Sign Up and Sign In pages to
                    give the user a better experience. To add, the user is now able to enter a promotion code for
                    MyPieceâ€™s new campaign at menu screen and this information is saved to a third-party server on
                    www.parse.com .</p>
                <p>Get the app on the App Store: <a href="http://itunes.com/apps/mypiece">http://itunes.com/apps/mypiece</a></p>

                          <p>A new UI was designed in order to avoid prompting the user a Terms and Conditions whenever
                              they sign up with Facebook or with an e-mail. I had to develop a different structure to disable
                              this action and correctly adding this feature where it is possible for the user to verify the Terms
                              and Conditions if they choose to do so.</p>
