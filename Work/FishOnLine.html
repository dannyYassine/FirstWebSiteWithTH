            <h4>FishOnLine</h4>
            <p>An easy to use social fishing app which allows friends to share their fishing locations to make this sport easy to share locations and post their catches online!
                Users will be notified via Push Notifications that their friends have just added a new fishing location and they can access that specific location from the home page MAP view.
                Users can write suggestions and techniques which proved to be successful in order to catch their fish at that specific location and their friends can view those recommendations.
                All information and pictures are stored on a third party server on www.parse.com, where push notifications are used to send to alerts to users and cloud code is used in order to
                add friends on this application.</p>
            <p>Coming Soon to the App Store! Presently under review.</p>
