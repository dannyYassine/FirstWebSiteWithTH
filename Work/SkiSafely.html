            <h4>SkiSafely</h4>
            <p>As for more freelance work, I was given the project template on PDF and I had figured out the internal structure of
                the application from the UI experience to seamlessly saving data to a server, all behind the scenes. Custom accessory views were designed and proved to be effective to give the user an easy and efficient involvement. entering their information.
                Ski Safely is an app for ski mountain patrollers to assist and aid skiers on their mountain. Users can input their
                contact information, address, emergency contact and medical history where ski patrollers are able to assist them faster and efficiently.</p>

                <p>This information is stored on a third party server, where the mountain employees can have access to the individual’s information.<p>
